# RESTful Web App with Java and Tigris

In this guide we will build a web application that accepts HTTP requests to
store and retrieve data in the Tigris backend. The application uses
[Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) framework.

This is a simplified implementation of an e-commerce use case - this is just
one of many use cases for how you could interact with Tigris!

Now let's get started locally with Tigris.

## Startup Tigris locally via Docker

import StartupLocally from "../includes/_startup_tigris_locally.mdx";

<StartupLocally />

## Setting up and starting the application

### Clone the starter application code repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/tigrisdata/tigris-starter-java.git
cd tigris-starter-java
```

### Build the project

The next step is to build the project

```shell
mvn clean install
```

### Run the application

Next run the application from your favorite IDE. An example using **IntelliJ
IDEA** is shown below

![intellij_launcher image](/img/screenshots/intellij_launcher.png)

:::info
A successful launch of the application will end with the log entry

```shell
[main] INFO  c.t.starter.spring.TigrisInitializer - Finished initializing Tigris
```

:::

## Testing the application

Try out the REST API at
[http://localhost:8080/swagger.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger.html)

Let's create a user and a product.

### Create a User

```shell
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8080/users/create' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Jania McGrory",
  "balance": 6045.7
}'
```

### Create a Product

```shell
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8080/products/create' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Vanilla Beans",
  "quantity": 6358,
  "price": 4.39
}'
```

These newly added User and Product documents were persisted in the Tigris
backend.

## Extend the application

Now let's set up a HTTP handler that will leverage Tigris to insert data
into the _orders_ collection while updating the data in the _users_ and
_products_ collections.

:::info
One of the main features of Tigris is the ability to perform ACID
transactions. We will perform the insert and update operations in a
transaction ensuring that the collections are consistently updated.

Open the project in your favorite IDE and add the following to
`com.tigrisdata.starter.controller.OrderController`

**Additional Imports**

```java title="OrderController.java"
import java.util.Collections;
import org.springframework.http.HttpStatus;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PostMapping;
import com.tigrisdata.db.client.UpdateFields;
```

**HTTP handler**

```java title="OrderController.java"
@PostMapping("{user_id}/{product_id}/{qty}")
public ResponseEntity<String> purchase(
        @PathVariable("user_id") int userId,
        @PathVariable("product_id") int productId,
        @PathVariable("qty") int quantity)
        throws TigrisException {
  tigrisStarterDatabase.transact(
          session -> {
            try {
              // read the user and product documents
              User user = userCollection.readOne(session, Filters.eq("id", userId)).get();
              Product product = productCollection.readOne(session, Filters.eq("id", productId)).get();

              // ensure that a user is never allowed to purchase products worth more than
              // their available balance, and that we never create orders that exceed the
              // amount of available product
              if (product.getQuantity() >= quantity
                      && product.getPrice() * quantity <= user.getBalance()) {
                double orderTotal = product.getPrice() * quantity;
                double newUserBalance = user.getBalance() - orderTotal;
                int newProductQuantity = product.getQuantity() - quantity;
                userCollection.update(
                        session,
                        Filters.eq("id", userId),
                        UpdateFields.newBuilder().set("balance", newUserBalance).build());

                productCollection.update(
                        session,
                        Filters.eq("id", productId),
                        UpdateFields.newBuilder().set("quantity", newProductQuantity).build());

                orderCollection.insert(
                        session,
                        new Order(
                                userId,
                                orderTotal,
                                Collections.singletonList(new Order.ProductItem(productId, quantity))));

              } else {
                // throw this to automatically rollback current transaction
                throw new IllegalStateException("Not enough balance");
              }
            } catch (TigrisException ex) {
              // handle this or throw this to automatically rollback current transaction
              throw new IllegalStateException(ex);
            }
          });
  // transaction successful
  return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.OK).body("Purchased successfully");
}
```

Run the application again and use the newly added HTTP endpoint to create an
order.

### Create an Order

```shell
curl -X 'POST' 'http://localhost:8080/order/1/1/20'
```

## Understanding what just happened

The starter project includes the Java model classes corresponding to the
three collections _users_, _products_ and _orders_ located in the Java
package `com.tigrisdata.starter.collections`.

When you launched the application, code located in
`com.tigrisdata.starter.spring.TigrisInitializer#run` created the database
and registered the schema with the Tigris backend based on the three collection
models.

You wrote a new HTTP handler that used Tigris' transaction feature. The
transaction involved reading data, validating that certain conditions around
the product quantity and user's balance are met, and finally inserting a new
order together with updating the users and products collections.
