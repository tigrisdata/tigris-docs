# RESTful Web App with Go and Tigris

In this guide we will build a web application that accepts HTTP requests to
store and retrieve data in the Tigris backend. The application uses
[Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) framework for serving HTTP requests.

This is a simplified implementation of an e-commerce use case - this is just
one of many use cases for how you could interact with Tigris!

Now let's get started locally with Tigris.

## Startup Tigris locally via Docker

The first step is to install the CLI

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="macOS" label="macOS">

```shell
curl -sSL https://tigris.dev/cli-macos | sudo tar -xz -C /usr/local/bin
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Linux" label="Linux">

```shell
curl -sSL https://tigris.dev/cli-linux | sudo tar -xz -C /usr/local/bin
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Now we start up Tigris locally using the _tigris_ cli

```shell
tigris local up
```

Once this command has completed, Tigris server will be available on port
`8081`.

## Setting up and starting the service

### Clone the starter application code repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/tigrisdata/tigris-starter-go.git
cd tigris-starter-go
```

### Build and start the application

```shell
go build .
./tigris-starter-go
```

## Testing the service

Now let's fire up the terminal and run the commands below to test the service.

### Insert users

First off let's create two new users: Jane and John

```shell
curl http://localhost:8080/users/create \
      -X POST \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -d '{"id":1,"Name":"John","Balance":100}'
curl http://localhost:8080/users/create \
      -X POST \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -d '{"id":2,"Name":"Jane","Balance":200}'
```

### Insert products

Next go ahead and create two products: Avocado and Gold

```shell
curl http://localhost:8080/products/create \
      -X POST \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -d '{"id":1,"Name":"Avocado","Price":10,"Quantity":5}'
curl http://localhost:8080/products/create \
      -X POST \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -d '{"id":2,"Name":"Gold","Price":3000,"Quantity":1}'
```

### Place a couple of orders

#### Low balance

Let's start off with an order that fails because John is trying to purchase 1
unit of Gold that costs $3000.00, while John's balance is $100.00.

```shell
curl http://localhost:8080/orders/create \
      -X POST \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -d '{"id":1,"UserId":1, "Products" : [{"id":2,"Quantity":1}]}'
```

#### Low stock

The next order fails as well because Jane is trying to purchase 30 Avocados that
cost $300.00, while Jane's balance is $200.00.

```shell
curl http://localhost:8080/orders/create \
      -X POST \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -d '{"id":1,"UserId":2, "Products" : [{"id":1,"Quantity":30}]}'
```

#### Successful purchase

Now an order that succeeds as John purchases 5 Avocados that cost
$50.00 and John's balance is $100.00, which is enough for the purchase.

```shell
curl http://localhost:8080/orders/create \
      -X POST \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -d '{"id":1,"UserId":1, "Products" : [{"id":1,"Quantity":5}]}'
```

### Check the balances and stock

Now go ahead and confirm that both John's balance and the Avocado stock is
up-to-date.

```shell
curl http://localhost:8080/users/read/1
curl http://localhost:8080/products/read/1
```

## Code walk through

This web application uses [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) framework
for serving REST requests and Tigris as the backend to persist the data.

### Setting up the database and collections

The `main` function in the application initializes the Tigris backend

```go
db, err := tigris.OpenDatabase(ctx,
    &tigris.DatabaseConfig{Config: config.Config{URL: "localhost:8081"}},
    "shop", &User{}, &Product{}, &Order{})
```

There are a couple of important things to note here:

- `User`, `Product` and `Order` are types that declare the data model for
  the application.
- The call to `OpenDatabase` function is instantaneous. It either creates
  the database `shop` and the three collections if they do not exist, or
  updates the schema of the collections if they already exist.

### Setting up the HTTP routes

The following code shows how the HTTP routes are set up

```go
setupCRUDRoutes[User](r, db, "users")
setupCRUDRoutes[Product](r, db, "products")
```

This sets up the `create`, `delete` and `read` routes. Note how we are using
Go generics which reduces the code boilerplate and allows reusing the same
function to set up HTTP routes for the three collections.

The code below demonstrates how the `/create` HTTP route is set up

```go
func setupCRUDRoutes[T interface{}](r *gin.Engine, db *tigris.Database, name string) {
	setupReadRoute[T](r, db, name)

	r.POST(fmt.Sprintf("/%s/create", name), func(c *gin.Context) {
		coll := tigris.GetCollection[T](db)

		var u T
		if err := c.Bind(&u); err != nil {
			return
		}

		if _, err := coll.Insert(c, &u); err != nil {
			c.AbortWithStatusJSON(http.StatusBadRequest, gin.H{"error": err.Error()})
			return
		}

		c.JSON(http.StatusCreated, u)
	})

	r.DELETE(fmt.Sprintf("/%s/delete/:id", name), func(c *gin.Context) {
		coll := tigris.GetCollection[T](db)

		id, _ := strconv.Atoi(c.Param("id"))

		if _, err := coll.Delete(c, filter.Eq("id", id)); err != nil {
			c.AbortWithStatusJSON(http.StatusBadRequest, gin.H{"error": err})
			return
		}

		c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{"Status": "DELETED"})
	})
}
```

A couple of important points to note about the `setupCRUDRoutese` function:

- The code `coll := tigris.GetCollection[T](db)` is responsible for
  instantiating an object of the collection.
- Once instantiated, `coll` has the methods for inserting, deleting and reading
  documents in the collection.
- After binding the object from the request body `c.Bind(&u)`, it is then
  inserted into the collection via the function call `coll.Insert(c, &u)`.
  Once this function call returns Tigris guarantees that the object has been
  persisted.

### Performing transaction across the collections

The order creation route `/order/create` needs to be transactional to ensure
that all the three collections are consistently updated. Tigris supports
interactive ACID transactions out-of-the-box which provide the guarantees
we are looking for.

```go
func setupCreateOrderRoute(r *gin.Engine, db *tigris.Database) {
	r.POST("/orders/create", func(c *gin.Context) {
		var o Order
		// Read the request body into o
		if err := c.Bind(&o); err != nil {
			return
		}

		// Perform the read, update and insert on the users, products and orders
		// collections in a transaction. If the function passed to db.Tx
		// returns an error then the transaction will be automatically rolled back.
		// If no error is returned, the transaction will be automatically committed.
		err := db.Tx(c, func(txCtx context.Context) error {
			// Fetch an object of the users collection
			users := tigris.GetCollection[User](db)

			// Read the user with order's UserId
			u, err := users.ReadOne(txCtx, filter.Eq("id", o.UserId))
			if err != nil {
				return err
			}

			// Fetch an object of the products collection
			products := tigris.GetCollection[Product](db)

			orderTotal := 0.0

			for _, v := range o.Products {
				// Fetch the product in the order from the collection
				p, err := products.ReadOne(txCtx, filter.Eq("id", v.Id))
				if err != nil {
					return err
				}

				// Verify that product quantity in the inventory is more than the
				// product quantity in the order
				if p.Quantity < v.Quantity {
					return fmt.Errorf("low stock on product %v", p.Name)
				}

				// Update the inventory to reduce the product quantity based on the
				// quantity in the order
				_, err = products.Update(txCtx, filter.Eq("id", v.Id),
					fields.Set("Quantity", p.Quantity-v.Quantity))
				if err != nil {
					return err
				}

				orderTotal += p.Price * float64(v.Quantity)
			}

			// Verify that the user has enough balance to be able to support the
			// order purchase
			if orderTotal > u.Balance {
				return fmt.Errorf("low balance. order total %v", orderTotal)
			}

			// Update the user's balance to account for the order purchase
			_, err = users.Update(txCtx, filter.Eq("id", o.UserId),
				fields.Set("Balance", u.Balance-orderTotal))
			if err != nil {
				return err
			}

			// Returning no error means that the transaction will be committed.
			return nil
		})

		// If there is no error returned then the transaction was successfully
		// committed and the data has been consistently updated in Tigris.
		if err != nil {
			c.AbortWithStatusJSON(http.StatusBadRequest, gin.H{"error": err.Error()})
			return
		}

		c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{"Status": "PURCHASED"})
	})
}
```
