# Overview

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/tigrisdata/tigris-client-go.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/tigrisdata/tigris-client-go)

Tigris provides an easy-to-use and intuitive interface for Go. Setting up
the database is instantaneous, as well - no need for tedious configuration.
You define the data model as part of the application code, which then drives
the database infrastructure without you having to configure and provision
database resources.

## Prerequisites

The Tigris client depends on
[Golang generics](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/generics) which requires Go 1.18
or newer.

## Installation

```shell
go get -u github.com/tigrisdata/tigris-client-go@latest
```
