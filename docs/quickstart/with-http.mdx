# Quickstart: HTTP API

Tigris offers simple and intuitive APIs to make it easy for you get started
with any data architecture needs!

Setting up the database is instantaneous, as well - no need for tedious
configuration. While schema enforcement on collections ensures that the data
is well-structured and less prone to errors.

The following guide will get you up and running using the HTTP APIs.

First let's review what you need to get going.

## Prerequisites

All you'll need is any computer running macOS or Linux, with
[docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed.

## Working locally

First let's get started with Tigris locally.

### Startup Tigris locally via Docker

The first step is to install the CLI

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="macOS" label="macOS">

```shell
curl -sSL https://tigris.dev/cli-macos | sudo tar -xz -C /usr/local/bin
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Linux" label="Linux">

```shell
curl -sSL https://tigris.dev/cli-linux | sudo tar -xz -C /usr/local/bin
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Next we start up Tigris locally using the _tigris_ cli

```shell
tigris local up
```

Once this command has completed, Tigris server will be available on port
`8081`.

## Creating database and collection

For this quickstart we will create a database named _sampledb_ and then
create a collection _users_ inside it.

Creating a database is as easy as calling an API, and it is ready in an
instant.

```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/v1/databases/sampledb/create
```

Similarly, a collection is instantaneously created through the API. In
Tigris, a collection is an ordered set of records called documents that all
follow a specific schema and whose fields are strongly typed.

```shell
curl http://localhost:8081/api/v1/databases/sampledb/collections/users/createOrUpdate \
      -X POST \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "schema": {
          "title": "users",
          "properties": {
            "balance": {
              "type": "number"
            },
            "id": {
              "type": "integer",
              "format": "int32",
              "autoGenerate": true
            },
            "name": {
              "type": "string"
            }
          },
          "primary_key": [
            "id"
          ]
        }
      }'
```

The schema of the collections created above can be fetched as follows

```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/v1/databases/sampledb/collections/users/describe
```

## Insert some documents

The following example will replace documents with the same `id` if they
already exist, or create new documents if they don't exist with the same `id`.

```shell
curl http://localhost:8081/api/v1/databases/sampledb/collections/users/documents/insert \
      -X POST \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "documents": [
          {"name": "Jania McGrory", "balance": 6045.7},
          {"name": "Bunny Instone", "balance": 2948.87}
        ]
      }'
```

## Read a document

### Using the primary key field

Read the document from the collection by using its `id`.

```shell
curl http://localhost:8081/api/v1/databases/sampledb/collections/users/documents/read \
      -X POST \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "filter": {"id": 1}
      }'
```

### Using any field in the schema

Read the document from the collection by using the field `name`.

```shell
curl http://localhost:8081/api/v1/databases/sampledb/collections/users/documents/read \
      -X POST \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "filter": {"name": "Jania McGrory"}
      }'
```

## Update a document

Update one of the fields in a document by using its `id`.

```shell
curl http://localhost:8081/api/v1/databases/sampledb/collections/users/documents/update \
      -X PUT \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "fields": {
          "$set": {"balance": 2448.87}
        },
        "filter": {"id": 2}
      }'
```

## Delete documents

Finally, use the delete API to remove the documents from the collection
based on the filter.

```shell
curl http://localhost:8081/api/v1/databases/sampledb/collections/users/documents/delete \
      -X DELETE \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "filter": {
          "$or": [
            {"id": 1},
            {"id": 2}
          ]
        }
      }'
```
