# Quickstart: CLI

:::tip

Getting started with Tigris is extremely fast and simple. The following
guide will get you up and running using the CLI.

First let's review what you need to get going.

## Prerequisites

All you'll need is any computer running macOS or Linux, with
[docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed.

## Working locally

Now let's get started locally with Tigris in three easy steps:

### 1. Startup Tigris locally via Docker

The first step is to install the CLI

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="macOS" label="macOS">

```shell
curl -sSL https://tigris.dev/cli-macos | sudo tar -xz -C /usr/local/bin
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Linux" label="Linux">

```shell
curl -sSL https://tigris.dev/cli-linux | sudo tar -xz -C /usr/local/bin
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Note that you'll need to have [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
installed already.

Next we start up Tigris locally using the _tigris_ cli

```shell
tigris local up
```

Once this command has completed, Tigris server will be available on port
`8081`.

### 2. Create sample schema

For this quickstart we will model a simple ecommerce app. The data would be
stored in three collections _products_, _users_ and _orders_.

Let's use the CLI to generate the sample schema and create the three
collections in the database named _sampledb_.

```shell
tigris generate sample-schema --create
```

The schema of the collections created can be fetched as follows

```shell
tigris describe collection sampledb orders
```

### 3. Insert and read data

The following example will set up the data model, insert data into the _users_
and _products_ collections and then read it back.

One of the main features of Tigris is the ability to perform ACID
transactions. We will perform a transaction that involves inserting and
updating documents in the _orders_, _users_ and _products_ collections.

Now lets fire up the CLI and use the Tigris APIs to perform CRUD operations on
the data.

#### Insert some data into the user and product collections

```shell
tigris insert sampledb users \
'[
    {"id": 1, "name": "Jania McGrory", "balance": 6045.7},
    {"id": 2, "name": "Bunny Instone", "balance": 2948.87}
]'
```

```shell
tigris insert sampledb products \
'[
    {"id": 1, "name": "Vanilla Beans", "quantity": 6358, "price": 4.39},
    {"id": 2, "name": "Cheese - Provolone", "quantity": 5726, "price": 16.74},
    {"id": 3, "name": "Cake - Box Window 10x10x2.5", "quantity": 5514, "price": 36.4}
]'
```

#### Read the data that was inserted

```shell
tigris read sampledb users '{"id": 1}'
```

```shell
tigris read sampledb products '{"id": 3}'
```

#### Perform a transaction that modifies all three collections

```shell
tigris transact sampledb \
'[
  {
    "insert": {
      "collection": "orders",
      "documents": [{
          "id": 1, "user_id": 1, "order_total": 53.89, "products": [{"id": 1, "quantity": 1}]
        }]
    }
  },
  {
    "update": {
      "collection": "users", "fields": {"$set": {"balance": 5991.81}}, "filter": {"id": 1}
    }
  },
  {
    "update": {
      "collection": "products", "fields": {"$set": {"quantity": 6357}}, "filter": {"id": 1}
    }
  }
]'
```

The transaction we just executed updates three different collections in a
single atomic transaction, all while running at an isolation level of strict
serializability.

:::info
Note that because we're using the CLI, the transaction doesn't appear to be
interactive. When using the Tigris client library the transaction would be
interactive, and we could enforce constraints within our application. Such as,
ensuring that the user has enough balance or that there is enough available
product.

See the [Go quick start](with-go.md) section for an example of how we can
leverage Tigris' transactions to easily and automatically ensure that no
user is ever allowed to purchase products worth more than their available
balance, and that we never create orders that exceed the amount of available
product, even if thousands of users are all trying to purchase the same
product at the same time!
