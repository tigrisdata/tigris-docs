# Quickstart: TypeScript

The following guide will get you up and running with TypeScript.

:::tip
Define the data model in the application code, which sets up the database
instantaneously. Easily evolve the data model as your application evolves
without worrying about breaking a rigid schema.

Quickly add data and easily retrieve or edit that data through simple and
intuitive APIs. Continue using your preferred programming language, there is
no new database query language to learn.

First let's review what you need to get going.

## Prerequisites

All you'll need is any computer running macOS or Linux, with the following
installed:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) v12 or later

Next, let's get started with Tigris locally.

## Startup Tigris locally via Docker

import StartupLocally from "../includes/_startup_tigris_locally.mdx";

<StartupLocally />

## Quickstart

Let's run following command to scaffold a Tigris quickstart app that
demonstrates Tigris operations.

```shell
mkdir tigris-quickstart-ts && cd tigris-quickstart-ts
npx create-tigris-app
```

## Code overview

Above code scaffolded the project with following directory structure.

```
.
├── package.json
├── src
│   ├── app.ts
│   ├── index.ts
│   ├── lib
│   │   └── config.ts
│   └── models
│       └── user.ts
└── tsconfig.json
```

- `index.ts` is the entry-point for the generated application.
- `app.ts` is the application class. `tigrisQuickstart` method
  demonstrates the tigris operations.
- `lib/config.ts` contains the tigris client initialization.
- `models/user.ts` contains the data-container and schema for `users`
  collection.
