# Data Modeling

Tigris enables the data models to be declared as part of the
application code. These data models are then converted to appropriate
objects, such as collections, on the backend.

import DocCardList from "@theme/DocCardList";
import { useCurrentSidebarCategory } from "@docusaurus/theme-common";

In the following sections, we will introduce the following concepts:

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items} />
