# Overview

Here you'll find ways to get started, understand core concepts, and explore
a variety of resources to help you get the most from Tigris data platform. We
also recommend joining our
[Slack Community](https://join.slack.com/t/tigrisdatacommunity/shared_invite/zt-16fn5ogio-OjxJlgttJIV0ZDywcBItJQ)
for help along the way.

## What is Tigris?

[Tigris](https://github.com/tigrisdata/tigris) is a modern, scalable backend
for building real-time websites and apps. The zero-ops approach of Tigris
means developers can focus on their application rather than managing
databases or data pipelines. While our API makes it easy to get started with
any data architecture needs!

We are fully committed to open source and embrace the open exchange of
information, collaborative development and transparency.
