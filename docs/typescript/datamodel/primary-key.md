# Primary Key

A primary key uniquely identifies a document in the collection and enforces
the unique constraint. In the absence of a user-defined primary key, it is
auto-generated.

## Defining a Primary Key

The example above demonstrates how primary key is defined. The `order`
attribute in `primaryKey` represents the order of the field in the primary key.
While `autoGenerate: true` represents that the values for this field will be
automatically generated by the Tigris server.

## Composite Primary Key

Composite primary keys are also supported but in case of composite keys
order of the fields is important. The example below demonstrates
how the order of the fields are defined in case of a composite primary key

```typescript
// data container
interface User extends TigrisCollectionType {
  userId?: number;
  email: string;
}

// schema definition
const userSchema: TigrisSchema<User> = {
  userId: {
    type: TigrisDataTypes.INT32,
    primary_key: {
      order: 1,
      autoGenerate: true,
    },
  },
  email: {
    type: TigrisDataTypes.STRING,
    primary_key: {
      order: 2,
    },
  },
};
```

## Auto-generated Primary Key

If no primary key is specified in the model, Tigris automatically adds a
special `_id` field of type `string` (UUID) as the primary key.

At later point if you want to read this field to your data container you can
add this field into your data container.

```typescript
export interface User extends TigrisCollectionType {
  _id: string;
  userId: number;
  name: string;
  balance: number;
}
```

Note: you do not need to explicitly mention this `_id: string` field to your
schema definition. It is available implicitly (as long as you don't have
primary key defined).
