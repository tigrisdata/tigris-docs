# Overview

There are no restrictions on specific data models used by the developers to
store the data. The goal is to provide the best of both worlds: schema
flexibility of document models, schema enforcement of relational models.

## Core Concepts

### Database

A database is a group of collections.

### Collections

Collection is the core entity which is used by developers to model their
entities. A collection is analogous to a relational table - collection of
structured records called documents that all follow a specific schema and
data is strongly typed. Schema can evolve and a collection can have records
with different schema versions.

### Documents

Data records are stored as JSON documents. Documents are composed of
field-value pairs. The value of the field can be any of the JSON data types.

```json
{
  "field1": 1,
  "field2": "string",
  "field3": { "field1": "value1", "field2": "value2" },
  "fieldN": "valueN"
}
```

### Primary Key

Every collection must have a primary key. A primary key uniquely identifies
a document in the collection and enforces the unique constraint. A primary
key can be defined on a single field or can be composite. Documents are
stored in sorted order according to the primary key.
