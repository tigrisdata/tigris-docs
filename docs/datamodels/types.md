# Data Types

There are three categories of data types supported:

- **Primitive**: Strings, Numbers, Binary Data, Booleans, UUIDs, DateTime
- **Complex:** Arrays, Sets
- **Objects**: A container data type defined by the user that stores fields
  of primitive types, complex types as well as other Objects

## Type and Format

The data types are derived from the types defined in the JSON schema
[specification](https://json-schema.org/specification.html).

The `type` and `format` properties in schemas are used to determine the
data type of the field. The `type` property indicates the type of the field.
The `format` property provides additional information about the underlying type.
Fields will always have a `type` property, but some may also have a `format`
property. The JSON schema
[specification](https://json-schema.org/specification.html) already defines
a set of common formats. We support these formats and define others as well.

For optimal performance and efficient data layout, we also impose some
restrictions on what data types can be used for primary key fields.

The full list of supported `type` and `format` are listed below.

:::tip
Note that the [client libraries](/category/client-libraries) that we provide
use language-idiomatic types for the types and formats below. For example,
while a 64-bit integer is represented as type _integer_ in JSON requests and
responses, but our Java client library uses the Java _long_ type.
